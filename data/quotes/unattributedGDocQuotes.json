There was some unkind words exchanged and I was asked to stand up and fight. I was certainly up for it after how annoying the guy was towards me, but given I was outnumbered, surrounded by fifty police officers as well as being with a new peace-loving friend, I decided to just grit my teeth and move away.” [laugh] Yes, that’s always the right answer. “I’m about to turn 19. I’ve noticed that as I get older I’m put in more of these types of situations even when keeping to myself. So I ask you: Should I man up and attempt to take out the next schmoe that goes off on me, or should I continue to back off?” Well Ramsey, us McElroys are lovers, not fighters.

Recently, she’s been trying to connect with me, which in her mind means going out to buy ‘gangsta’ clothes, baggy pants and lots of Ed Hardie, bling, and lots of rap music. Now she follows me around asking ‘What’s up, J-Dog?’ and blasting 50 Cent from our home speaker system.” [Travis moans] “At first it was easy to ignore, but now she’s talking like this ‘G-Ma’ thing, as she calls it outside, and even approaches my ‘home dogs’ when we’re at the mall and stuff.” [laughter] “What’s even weirder about this whole situation is that I’m more of an alternative guy, or even hipster myself. [cracking up] So I have no idea where she got this scheme from! It’s terrifying!” [laughter] [in a high-pitched voice] “Help me, I’m so confused as to what to do! [normal voice] Should I mock her or something? James from Gmail.” Oh Christ, James!",
      "He says, “Hey brothers McElroy! And hello to all you amazing, good-looking listeners. Tristan the marine here. I’m writing this email with a heavy heart and a frown on my face, because it pains me to say the following: The next episode of MBMBAM will be the last episode of McElroy goodness I will get to listen to for three long months. See I’m leaving for bootcamp at recruit training depot, Parris Island, August 8th. Other than occasional letters, I will have no contact with the outside world for thirteen weeks. I wanted to write to tell the three of you, and again those of you listening, what an encouragement you’ve been to me and how much joy you’ve brought into my life. ",
      "“In the time since MBMBAM launched, I’ve had a wild ride getting ready to go to bootcamp. While I will never doubt my commitment to serving my country and protecting our precious freedoms, there have been times when the light at the end of the tunnel was very, very dim.” I’m gonna skip ahead a little bit. “Over the last few months, MBMBAM has reminded me what I’m joining for. I’m joining for the people of this nation like Justin, Griffin, and Travis, and all the listeners who care more about quality of life for other people than themselves. The people who are always willing to tell you straight up that you need to pack your shit and get the hell out of your situation, because it is the only way. I’m proud to serve my country, and even more proud to know that I’m serving for amazing people like you. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now seriously, pack up your bags. No one wants you around. With all the pride and gratitude, Tristan the Marine.” And he gives a special shout out to Bob Ball for the encouragement, and all the listeners for encouraging him, and he says ooh rah and semper fidelis.

No way!",

I've gone to see the dentist, dentist says, \"It's all made up, you're just thinking to hard about it, just eat your fucking food.\" But it's all goofed up, and so every bite of food I take is precious, because it could be the last.",

      "“Primary consumer of apple juice has traditionally been kids, concerned around the sugar content of juice. Along with the aging population and the household having fewer kids has led to apple juice's decline in recent years. Apple juice is loaded with health benefits that are relevant to adults, yet it has never been directly targeted or promoted to them. The pure and local nature of our apple juice is on trend with today's adult consumer. Note: solutions with alcohol are not compatible with our brand.” So think of something else to say, Justin and Travis, yeah.",

      "And here's the thing: it's nonalcoholic and it says on the sign, \"Does not contain alcohol.\" And I just wanted to say to Taco Bell, this is sort of a mini-Munch Squad diversion, I guess: if you have to specify that a product does not contain alcohol, maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board on what you named the thing.

Just make whatever bogus claims you want!",
      "Because here's the thing: I think the sugar-free gummy bears are the ones that threw the party inside of me, but the apple juice was certainly a guest of honor, and it's gonna be hard for me to divorce it from its role in the festivities. So, whatever they can do to sorta just get that out of my mind, so I can enjoy the taste again... I'll take my answer off the air. ",

I'd feel like I'm a fucking Diablo II barbarian just chugging a potion, gettin' ready for battle. You know what I mean?",
      "I think the thing that apple juice is gonna have to overcome is the fact that it is entirely sugar. I mean it's just pure sugar and adults are a little more savvy about that. Like if you want me to drink something, like a 12-ounce glass of apple juice, you're probably gonna have to do better than a fucking half cup of sugar in the bottle of apple juice that I am consuming. That lunacy! No adult is gonna buy that! Maybe stop making it? ",

      "Jimmy Buffett: [chuckles] They were actually lost tapes in some, y’know, closet or storage facility, and when they went to sell the studio they opened it up and there they were. So be that as it may, it was kind of a time machine, y’know? So I was interested in the fact that there were over 120 songs there and I could not remember writing that many songs.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: That’s what kinda got me interested so I wanted to go listen to ’em all, and so I did and then I start laughin’, and it was kind of fun and amusing ’cause good god did I sound like— I sounded so much, and I knew who I was channeling in those days, and it was Gordon Lightfoot and boy it was just, it was way too close, he should’ve just sued me.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: So I listened to ’em all, and then I tried to figure out what to do with ’em and the interesting thing was, y’know, first idea was, ‘is this worth anything, would people want to hear it?’ Because, y’know, once you get to one stage, if you survived this long in the business, it’s not like trying to do something new every year and kinda keep the ball rollin’. I just try to fmake things that if people wanna add to their collection based on what they’ve heard and been such loyal fans about before, and that sort of project is—",
      "So I kinda put it out, weighed it against those parameters, which were, y’know, would this be something fans would be interested in, something that was this raw and this far back, and I thought maybe they would but then the other thing that kinda pushed me to the conclusion of ‘yes, they would’ was that the songs themselves when I heard them kinda conjured up visions of the people playin’ ’em, what was goin’ on in my life at the time, which was actually nothing.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: ’Cause—",
      "Jimmy Buffett: [laughs] ’Cause nobody knew who I was except these five guys that I go to the studio with. I also thought it would be unique to capture these guys who were still (a) alive, and (b) immobile, who were the guys that kind of were the only ones that knew me at the time when they were putting bands together and helpin’ try to promote me coming out of the studio. So I thought that was kind of a unique thing to get their perspective in. And then my daughter did a video, a little documentary on all these guys who were in the studio so, that’s how the whole thing kinda, it grew into what it became.",
      "And then when it did come out I all of a sudden, I looked at it and the packaging alone was worth doin’ it ’cause Kim and her team, the people that did it out of New York, did a great job of putting this whole thing together. So again, I thought at that point we’d done what the objective was, was to make something that if people liked what we did they could add this to their collection, that’s what, that’s kinda the way it happened in a short version.",

      "Jimmy Buffett: [laughs] Finadelphia, I like that. From a city slicker to go sailing, I would certainly say that reading is the first thing to do, and read books and— because there’s so much great stuff out there, and if I was gonna boil it down, of course, Treasure Island was the first one— if you really want to read some good stuff, it would be the Patrick O’Brian series about, um, Aubery and— can’t remember— the captain, Captain Jack Aubery, and, I can’t remember his sidekick, but they’re—",
      "It’s a great series of books about the British Navy and Napoleonic wars, and the great thing about it is it gets into the way people actually lived on boats back then, y’know, we think of ’em as— you see them in movies and there’s just, there’s just pirates, there’s people on boats, I mean when they went, they didn’t know when they were comin’ back, they had live animals, y’know, they had— they all played music, too, because they were, y’know, there was no Wi-Fi back in those days.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: [laughs] And so, most sailors had an instrument or played an instrument, and it’s the way also that a lot of music and, uh, different music from around the world found its way to other cultures, was on boats. So, that all kind of— they’re great adventurers but they take the essence of sailing and of how people lived and how they entertained themselves, y’know, when they weren’t fighting, or when they weren’t off, y’know, in raging storms. There was a lot of dull time on boats, and believe me, as one who’s sailed a lot, you try to find some things to do.",

      "Jimmy Buffett: Okay, that’s good. So say two days out, it takes a little while to get kinda get your sailor’s legs about you, even if you’re on one of those big boats, ’cause you’re movin’, and stay away from the buffet, probably, would be a good other thing to do, till you get your sea legs. But even when you— even when I would go out on my little boats, once you left and you’re out there you kinda had to readjust your, y'know, your brain readjusts and your sense of balance has to readjust to whether you’re, y'know, on a big ship or a little ship it just automatically will do that ’cause you’re not on real land, y'know?",
      "So, if you ever notice you get tired out there, that’s your inner ear workin’ to keep your balance up, so, y’know, once you do leave land you have to re-acclimate to being on the water, so that’s like two days, and then after that, y’know, your anxiety should go away and you can relax.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: And the other thing I wouldn’t do is look at those ‘disaster at sea’ videos on YouTube before you go.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Yeah, especially the ones with the cruise ships getting smacked sideways by fifty foot wave, I wouldn’t watch that.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Hope that helped!",

      "Jimmy Buffett: Okay, it’s very simple. The sail is triangular so you have a mast and you raise the sail and sail is attached to the mast, but the sail has to move so the mast is vertical. And then the boom is the section of the mast that’s horizontal, that the sail attaches to so it can swing back and forth as— because you’ve got to catch the wind and the wind is always movin’, and the reason it’s called the boom is because, uh, when it does hit you in the head it goes ‘boom’.",
      "[Justin, Travis, and Griffin laugh]",
      "Jimmy Buffett: And a boom-bang is just a piece of line that’ll tie to the boat, it’ll keep it from going ‘boom’.",

And the fact of it is they don’t have any natural predators in the ocean, you can’t– yeah, the thing of it is they’re not, you’ll never get sick. You can’t—sick or terror which you can get from reef fish sometimes, that doesn’t happen in the flesh of the lionfish.",
      "And yes, it’s good, we sell it at the restaurant in Margaritaville, we make sushi out of it. And we’re trying, y’know, to get people interested in making it a commercial product which makes it something they’re, y’know— the price of it would increase so that more people would go catch ’em. Y’know, you can actually kill a fish and save a reef here, y’know, and that’s kind of an oxymoron when you’re trying to save the ocean. You’re trying to prevent everything from dying but you could knock off quite a few lionfish and it’s gonna help the ocean, so we’re kind of involved actively in some ways to promote that and people are doin’ it already.",
      "They have lionfish rodeos in Florida and all, but nobody’s really seen ’em as a food source until a couple people started figurin’ out that they were good and, we shot ’em about five or six years ago and just brought ’em up and cooked ’em and they were fine. Cleanin’ ’em’s a bit of a problem, but then, our people down at the— in our kitchen staff at the hotel in Hollywood have done just that, made it a real— an easier way to clean it and not get poked. And so the only dangers of that is in cleaning, it’s not gonna kill you though but it does hurt like hell. ",
      "But anyway we’re looking at better ways that we can make cleanin’ more efficiently and make ’em more of a food commodity, ’cause the fish does taste great and that’s a great way to get the invasive species under control. So we’re gonna go it, we’re doin’ it at the hotel, we’re gonna start doing it down at our local restaurant at the cruise ship dock in Belize, if you get— who’s going on the cruise, Travis or Griffin or Justin?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Just Travis, are you going to Belize?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Well I was gonna say, if you get down there, go try some lionfish, y’know.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Where you goin’?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Alright, you going to Cubo?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Oh, Cozumel, Cabo, okay.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: I’ve heard of it!",
      "Jimmy Buffett: That’s right— I’ve heard good things! Have you ever thought about doing an all-you-can-eat lionfish night at Margaritaville?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: I’m in! I— what I am gonna do is go out and when I get back from— I gotta go up and work on the musical, and when I get done with that I’m gonna go out on the boat with Carl, my head chef down there who kinda started this thing, and I’m gonna go out and shoot some lionfish with him and he’s gonna teach me how to clean ’em and we’re gonna cook ’em right there on the boat and then make a video.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Yes.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: No, not takin’ an AR-15 on the boat.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: ‘Tastyfish’, there ya go! Tastyfish?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: No, c’mon, yeah, c’mon, tuna have— tuna’s got enough problems here, we don’t gotta do that, but uh, ‘tastyfish’? Well you know, when you go to any restaurant down there, they’re sorta feeding you like ‘sea bass’?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: No, that’s a complete– uh, that’s fake fish.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Yeah, it’s– ",
      "Jimmy Buffett: They serve a lot of it at the White House, fake fish these days.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: But, no, it’s called the— let’s see, it’s the toothfish but it’s like Argentina, the South Atlantic toothfish. And that’s what they’re calling it, and to your point, nobody’s gonna eat a toothfish—",
      "Jimmy Buffett: —with that name, so they just basically renamed ’em ‘sea bass’.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: They’re not any bass in there, they’re toothfish, so the lionfish becomes the temptingly tasty fish.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: You notice that the beach has sand on it, correct?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Correct.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Beach survival tools...",
      "Jimmy Buffett: What I bring to the beach is my van that has everything in it.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Drive it— it’s four-wheel drive, you can drive on to the beach, and get a van. That’s the first thing I’d do, put all your stuff in it, and they make little vans and big vans, y’know, you can get a little Volkswagen van, four-wheel drive, let a little air out of the tires, put it out on the beach and there ya go! And you can take everything you want.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Avoca-Don’t, well, I think the thing of it is that, I would kind of research the fact of what’s going on in Puerto Rico in terms of agriculture and your avocado groves, which (a) still there? And if they’re not then I’m sure there’s some people— there’s a lot of people doing great things in Puerto Rico right now, I don’t know if you— did you see Jose Reso’s piece of 60 Minutes the other day about cooking down there? And if not you should check it out, I mean, he literally took the terrible situation with— there was, and as he said there was food there but, y’know, that were in charge didn’t know how to do it. He went down and in a matter of two weeks was cooking for a hundred thousand people a day, it’s a pretty amazing story.",
      "So there’s that kind of care and that kind of wanting to help on the ground in Puerto Rico and I bet you that somebody is reforesting it this moment or else evaluating where those giant beautiful avocados are so maybe you wanna get involved ’cause the thing about it is that disasters such as hurricanes are hitting. Growin’ up in Hurricane Alley on the Gulf Coast I lived amongst hurricanes, nature comes back pretty quick in the tropics. It’s amazing how fast things grow again, I think your avocados will be back.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: And maybe you could help ’em get back.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Yes.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: And I think that—",
      "Jimmy Buffett: They’re doing stuff down there, and y’know if you can get direct to people that are y’know, like— our hotel got severely damaged there, so we’re basically getting all of our employees back to work re— y’know, cleaning up and getting the hotel back in shape, y’know, and just trying at that level to make sure everybody has something to do, as the process of recovery’s going along.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Big Boy Job in Baltimore, hmm. I’d go find myself a local bar, that’s what I would do first, and— that probably had good crab cakes in it, I know some of those exist in Baltimore. And just, the other thing to do if you’re— is to get outside a little more, even if it’s cold or if it’s not pouring down rain, to go walk around without sunglasses or any glasses on. About 45 minutes a day, kinda recharge your batteries.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Uh, just take ’em off and try not to walk in traffic while you’re using your phone.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Okay?",
      "Jimmy laughing: No!",
      "Jimmy Buffett: There’re days, let’s say, that I get attentive, okay? I don’t know—",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Yeah, attentive. Being rather attentive in a situation might get at the top of the scale there, y’know? But I’d had a few close calls and it’s either I’m not still supposed to be here or [laughs] I’m makin’ up for lost time ’cause I should not be here, or I’m supposed to be here— either way I’m so glad I am here and I’m not on the front line anymore so I think the older you get, all the stresses of life seem to go away ’cause you don’t have a lot of time to deal with that shit, y’know? So why not go and try to enjoy every day you got and not let everything get you down?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: No, I tell y– I got my Apple Watch on, I’ll tell you what it is right now.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Okay, measuring now, okay... Let’s see here... It’s uh, 54 beats a minute.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: What’s yours? What’s yours, now?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: 99!",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Okay, so you’re— wait, this podcast is making your blood pressure rise, that’s cool!",
      "Jimmy Buffett: [laughs]",
      "Jimmy Buffett: I think the three of you have it together pretty well, I do!",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Yeah.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: It’s, y'know, it’s a bit of yin and yang there because of course it’s a dream come true and I’ve always loved musical theatre and the actual, uh, the actual fact that it’s happening, I mean, as I’ve been to shows, y’know, we’ve been in a whole area of New Orleans, Houston, now it’s Chicago, I sit out there in the audi— I love watching the audience because I don’t get out there that much and I love that this show really entertains them and I, I get a big kick out of watching people enjoy the show, and I, and I have to pinch myself to believe that this is actually happening, we’re going to Broadway, and then, I mean and Justin you were there, and when your good friend Lin-Manuel Miranda brought you to the show and then we get up, I think I felt when he came out and we did Margaritaville I go ‘God, this is cool!’ I got a little over than attentive, I got excited.",
      "[Justin, Travis, and Griffin laugh]",
      "Jimmy Buffett: When Lin-Manuel came on the stage, I got excited.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Oh my god, oh my god– okay, well let’s just say this: I like ’em both, but nobody gets killed in Margaritaville.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: No, but you know, we did it that day, Justin, I thought it was pretty cool to go get a history lesson and get— hell, I was crying at the end of Hamilton and that’s about the eighth or ninth time I’ve seen it. And when ‘Who Tells Your Story’ comes on they got me again, I mean, that’s what’s great about it. But you get a history lesson in the afternoon and feel like you’ve gone to group therapy and then go get a drink, go to Margaritaville!",
      "Jimmy Buffett: There’s only two more of ’em, but you’ll be able to do it in New York ’cause we’re right down the street from them in New York, too.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Perfect!",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Y’know what’s coming up too, that’s gon’ be kind of fun, the, uh–",
      "Jimmy Buffett: The Eagles, workin’ with the Eagles next summer.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Yeah, yeah, those tickets are out on sale now. I’ve known about it for a while, it doesn’t come as a surprise for me ’cause I’ve known about it.",
      "[all laugh]",
      "Jimmy Buffett: But it’s gonna be cool ’cause, y’know, I kinda got my big break openin’ for the Eagles way back when, for the Hotel California tour. We became great friends and they were very instrumental in me makin’ a big leap, and so, it’s gonna be— we haven’t played together since then and it’s gonna be a lot of fun.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: We’re doing with them— we’re doin’ Miami, Orlando, Minneapolis, goin’ to Minneapolis, Denver.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: And I think San Francisco, it’s gonna be fun.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: I’ve seen— y'know, I’ve seen three people in Cincinnati dressed like that. Can you tell me what color your shirt is, ’cause it’ll probably be too many people.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Huge muscles.",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Huge glistening muscles…",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Hawaiian shirt.",

      "Jimmy Buffett: Oh, well man you just sayin’ I made podcast history today?",
      "Jimmy Buffett: Wow, well thank you, ’cause I know a lot of people listen so, and you— yeah, I know there’s a reason for listening ’cause you guys are good.",

Three months in and they're just now telling me I must choose a song to encapsulate my entire being, a song that will be the soundtrack of my arrival to the professional world, a song of glory, of the literal blood, sweat, and tears I've given to graduate. Brothers, how do I pick the one perfect song that will escort me into the cold embrace of adulthood, pump up the rest of my class for graduation, and represent the essence of me? This is the most important decision of my life. ",

      "Fourteen Nights of Aroman is an asymmetrical, two-player unit and resource management card game. One player leads the defense of a medieval city while the other controls a re-awakening ancient evil. Each player will take turns building their economy and recruiting powerful units for the ongoing war. Both players recruit from the same five decks, but a high priest in service to the city behaves quite differently than a cult leader pledged to the dark.

If you do things like this that make your office seem like fun and quirky, like a cool place to work, sometimes it can get you out of doing real work.

Just like doing whatever tunes I felt like, trying to sell karaoke machines and the ill fated music streaming service “Rhapsody”, if memory serves correctly. So I would try to sell the two karaoke machines that we had in the store. I would open one of them, completely void it’s worth, and then I would just do karaoke. But you know what? It made it seem like a fun place to be and a fun place to shop, and I got out of workin’ for like four hours. So maybe you could swing something like that. ",

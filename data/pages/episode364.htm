[audience cheers] And their advice should never be followed. Travis insists he’s a “sexpert,” but if there’s a diploma on his wall, I haven’t seen it. I know it’s degree, Travis. [audience laughs] Also, this show isn’t for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening. [shouts] What’s up, you cool baby!?<br><br>[Theme Song performed live]<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Ladies and gentlemen, John Roderick!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Ladies and gentlemen, Clint McElroy.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, yeah.

Do you wanna get [laughing] weird?<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I think that was a yes.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That was the wrong answer.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: My MacBook Pro has 69% battery, it’s a sign!<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br>[various audience members shouting “Nice!”]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Nice, nice! Sorry, it’s like a– it’s like we’re out in the woods and if all the owls, instead of saying “whoo,” all said, “nice.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Nice! [audience laughs] Does the bear “nice” in the woods?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Who knows.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: I’d probably camp more if owls were like… “nice.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “Nice.” [audience laughs] [Griffin laughs] Do you want to introduce the show, Justin? Instead of–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: This is the show– hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era. I’m your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I’m your middlest brother, Travis McElroy. [audience cheers] Alright! Yeah!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Travis fuckin’– that– I want to break down what just happened. Travis fuckin’ waited until Justin’s cheer died down, so there was no cross pollination so he could–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I wanted it to be clear!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: So he could truly measure how– hi, I’m Thirty Under Thirty Media Luminary and baby brother, Griffin McElroy.<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: You know, here’s what’s up. I was about to say, “One of these days, we’ll have to go in reverse order.” I’m in the middle either way.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c2 c0">: [laughs]<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You know, we– what you just saw–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s a lot of Hennessy!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: It’s a lot of ginger ale, it’s a big cup.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: This is actually a small amount of Hennessy, it just looks large from where you’re seated.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Ahhhh.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It’s aptical illusion.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Would you ever call it “Hinger Ale?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Hinger Ale.” No, it’s called a “Horse’s Neck.” Um–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Gennessy.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay, I’ll just do with some jokes, now, if that’s okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: I want to move on to the joke portion. When Travis said, “I just wanted a clean sampling,” or whatever it was he said– I wasn’t paying attention– what you got a sample– there was the current Travis character, which is “Big Time Travis”–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs, clapping] Yeah, let’s get into this!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Or “My City Travis.” So here’s the thing. Whenever we go on a tour– and I don’t have an explanation for this, because it doesn’t happen at the holidays when they visit. Whenever we go on a tour, [laughs] we get a new Travis character.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It’s kind of like Doctor Who, except played by the same actor every time.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And usually the performance leaves something to be desired.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Here is some of the characters we have gotten previously. One is “Mordecai Travis,” which is not Mordecai the Johnny Depp character, but rather a character obsessed with the film “Mordecai”– [audience laughs] while lacking any sort of insight or context into what the film might actually be about. [audience laughs] So, just basically saying “Mordecai” a lot.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: No, it’s this: based off the poster, what I think the movie is about.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, it’s a very fleshed out character. There’s “Big Snapple,” who we only get in New York City and, again, sort of the depth of that character is, “What if they called it The Big Snapple?”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [giggles]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I asked for– because I wanted a reprieve from “Big Time Travis McElroy,” I was like, “Please, give me Big Snapple,” and he said, “No, that’s a New York boy. You don’t get him here.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: We did get a brief reprieve from “Big Time Travis McElroy,” who also is “My City McElroy,” so we get a lot of, “Well, that’s how we do it in my city.” San Diego. ‘Cause he got here a </span><span class="c0 c5">day </span><span class="c0">before we did. [audience laughs and cheers] The other one that we’ve gotten– I don’t know why we’ve gotten such a–<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I like– I’ll say this. We’re raggin’ on him. I really like the new character.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] The new character– and I don’t know why we’ve got this fucking–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] This is my favorite– this is going to, I think, last beyond tour, ‘cause it’s maybe my favorite thing I’ve ever done.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] We have this huge Noel-Coward-esque cast of characters that Travis is dipping into just for this one tour. And this one is, whenever there’s a dessert or rich food offered, we have to deny it, and then Travis has to say, “Oh, come on, let’s be bad. Just this once, let’s be bad.” [audience laughs] [Justin laughs] He did it with the cinnamon bun I had at breakfast today, he did it at the– we’ve been to the bar, the pool bar at the Marriott twice, he did it with churros both times there?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. [audience laughs] And he gets furious. The churros showed up and I reached over to grab one and Travis said, “No, no, no, no, no.” And I was like, “What the fuck are y– oh. [flatly] I really shouldn’t eat these churros.”<br><br>[audiences laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “These are going to go straight to my hips.” And then…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “No, let’s be bad.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Now, let’s– well, Travis, you can cut us off a slice. I want to drink the rest of the– God, we’ve got a show to do, I really shouldn’t…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Now… [a few audience members woop] Listen, we’ve worked really hard this weekend. [audience laughs] [high pitched soft voice] Let’s be bad! [audience cheers] Justin? I really think we’ve earned it. Just this once–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: This character by the way–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Just this once– I’m not done!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Okay.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Just this once.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: This character–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Let’s be– I’m not done!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Please, please be done.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [high pitched] Let’s be bad!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And… good. This character was born out of the fact that all of your meals here in San Diego, when you go to a restaurant, are apparently just like– they bring them to your table and just upend them out of of a fucking duffle bag because it’s the biggest fucking portion sizes I’ve ever seen in my life!<br><br>[audience laughing and then cheering]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: This is not a joke. We asked the waiter about it this morning and he said–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, it’s fucked up!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “I don’t get it either.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “I usually order off the kid’s menu,” is what he said. Sorry that we got rolling a little late. I know you guys were outside a little bit longer, so I’m sorry– I’m apologizing even though it wasn’t my fault at all.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Blame Mystery Science Theater 3000 for being too funny. For too long.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c2 c0">: Those creeps. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And too great. We’re gonna do an intermission, which we’ve never done before, but we realized there’s a thing, I guess they invented in like the opera in like the 16th century where the opera singers would be like, [imitates opera singer] “Man, I gotta piss.” [audience laughs] So we’re gonna do one of those and then after that we’re gonna come back and do some Q&amp;A… stuff– not Q&amp;A, that’s a fucked up way– that’s– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah! No!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: No, we’ll do–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Just do more show. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: If you’ve ever wondered how we do our thing…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: No.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Don’t do that. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: So yeah, we’ll have advice.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: There’ll just be more show, it’s not gonna be like a Behind the Scenes direct– it’s just going to be of the show. The second half. You know, like intermission? [audience laughs] But what that means is extra long and it’ll get a little weird in here, but we’re all– [a few audience members cheer] This is a safe place. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: During intermission, there will be– if they’re still out there– posters for sale, designed by Evan Palmer.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeh.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: They are–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. They’re fucking incredible.<br><br>[a few audience members cheer]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Beautiful.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: They’re really beautiful. And you can buy those–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: They are also pre-signed, so…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, so...<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: So partake.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. Let’s get into the shit. <br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “I have really pointy elbows!” [audience laughs] “Previously, this hasn’t been a problem. Someone once thanked me for elbowing them in the face by accident during San Diego Comic Con. But recently–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Wait, someone thanked...?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: I don’t understand that part.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c2 c0">: “Thank– yes! You knocked it back into place!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Several events have made me reconsider the advantages of being able to elbow anyone out of my way. I popped a friend’s air mattress with just my elbows.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Holy shit!<br><br>[audience laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That’s pretty serious. “And my partner will only cuddle with me conditionally out of fear that I’m going to make a wrong move and make her double over in pain.” [audience laughs] “Do you have any suggestions as to how I can stop inadvertently causing my loved ones pain and financial ruin?” From H.E.R. [audience laughs] H.E.R., are you here? Are you “her?”<br><br>[someone in the audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Hi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: It’s really dark.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Hello. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Hey, what’s up?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Okay. Right off the bat– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: If you could just shout, why did the person thank you for elbowing them?<br><br>[inaudible reply from H.E.R.]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, okay.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Ohh.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Ohh!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: You were using your elbows as sort of a– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait, hold on. So they weren’t really thanking you for elbowing, specifically, for elbowing them in the face.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Wait, wait, I need to– I need to repeat what she said into the microphone, for the posterity.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [to H.E.R.] What’d you say?<br><br>[H.E.R. repeats their answer]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: No, wait–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: No, there’s not.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: They were looking for the place where the ticket was and you pointed them in the right direction with your elbow.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Can a dull elbow not accomplish that [laughing] same task? [audience laughs] “Oh, check this out, I got two of these!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Did you really– okay, I don’t– mmm.  Did you really– wait, this just– everyone, stay out of this. [audience laughs] This is just between me and… her.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: H.E.R.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [softly] Did you really pop an air mattress? [audience laughs] With your elbows?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [repeating another audience member’s reply] “It was mine!” Okay– yeah, no, there’s–<br><br>[audience laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, there– we got evidence, we have– the wronged party is here.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Was it– did you lay down and then turn over and then psshhhh?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Did you wake up on a flat piece of plastic and think, “not again”?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “These elbows!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Is it–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: And then you had to, like, Incredible Hulk walk down the street, hitchhiking, “do doo doo.”<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Well, no, you’d– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Are we talking, like, apocalypse-style bone spurs coming out of them?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Yeah, I was about to ask if it was a jagged bone spur situation. Sorry we’re asking you so many questions, you’re sitting so far away.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: We just wanna know if you’re Doomsday. [audience laughs] It’s Comic Con, people get that joke! [a few audience members cheer] He had bony elbows.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I mean, I’m sure there’s some sort of orthopedic surgery option, but that’s not fun. And also, God doesn’t make any mistakes, you got those elbows for a reason.<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: You gotta Rudolph this shit!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: There’s some sort of Rudolph scenar– have you seen the movie–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [singing to the tune of Rudolph the Red Nosed Raindeer] “Won’t you [laughs] fuckin’ stab a bunch’a folks tonight.” [audience laughs] “I’m a–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s what’s going to happen, like, David Tennant&#39;s trying to get through Comic Con, he’s like, “No one will make room!” And you’re like, “I’ve got it, David!” Whump, whump, whump, whump, whump, whump, whump! [audience laughs] And he’s like, “Thank you!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Except you didn’t, because you got the surgery to get rid of them. Have you ever seen the movie “Signs”? It’s basically like that, except you’re gonna take all your glasses of water and throw them in a toilet.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “They’re allergic to water!” “Fuck, I cleaned all those up!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Oh, no!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Shit!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Where’s my baseball bat?!” “I don’t know, I’m a grown man! It’s probably in storage! I don’t know, go find it!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “I don’t know where the baseball bat is.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “I don’t know where your baseball–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “All the aliens look like big air mattresses! Fuckin’ sweet!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Aww, dammit, I had that surgery yesterday, I can’t defend Earth like Jesus wanted me to!” [audience laughs] God don’t make ugly.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Umm, we didn’t say anything remotely helpful. Do you all wanna Yahoo, though?<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I just saw your t-shirt, in the front row.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It says, “They horny for this one.” It’s very, very good. [audience laughs and cheers] This one was sent in by–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Somebody yelled, “We are!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: This one was sent in by level 9000 Ya-Drew druid Drew Davenport, thank you Drew! [audience cheers] Oh! Are you here, Drew? Just like shout a big barbaric yell.<br><br>[Drew yells barbarically from the crowd]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Yeah. Fuckin’... [audience cheers] I was just shaken by your fuckin’ [laughing] Fus Ro Dah all the way up… thank you, Drew, you are a champion and a scholar. It’s by Ya-Drew Answers user… oh, [sing-song] the website’s not loading very good!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [sing-song] The “Something’s Gone Wrong” has popped up. I’ll refresh it. That was a mistake, so that is gone!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [sing-song] And it’s back. [regular voice] It’s still not giving me the user’s name. Fine. Fuck, it’s–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Christian Bale.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Christian Bale asks–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Christian Bale asks…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “My parents found my bong?” [audience laughs] “I had a water bottle bong in one of my sports bags in my closet and Mom thinks that it is for drugs but she’s not sure and it reeks of smoke, while my dad thinks it is for an experiment I did or something–” [audience laughs] “–I plan on telling them that I planned on seeing how a-leaves smell by burning a leaf on the bong and smelling the smoke, but I have never smoked in my life. Do you think I can get away with it? I’m very paranoid of getting caught.” I wonder why. <br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] You’re bad at this.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “I’m very paranoid of getting caught and they haven’t found bud or a lighter.” <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I would say to this question asker, you don’t have to be paranoid about getting caught. You got caught.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: You got caught, it sounds like.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: How cool is this dad? [audience laughs] “I think it’s for drugs!” “No.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “No, no, no, I’ve seen one of those before, that’s an Erlenmeyer flask.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “It’s fine.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: As a parent myself, I can promise you, your parents will take whatever to get out of this situation. If you give them something in the same zip code as plausible deniability, they’re gonna leap right on that. “Oh, we don’t have to parent this one. He was just burning leaves in a science experiment to see what they smelled like.” [audience laughs] You know how when you’re in science class and you burn something, and the science teacher’s like–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [sniffs loudly] Puff that shit!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Everybody– no, don’t waft it, you wuss, get in there!<br><br> [audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: First puff </span><span class="c0 c5">this </span><span class="c0">shit, it’s the control group. Now that one! Science!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. How does that smell? Cool, that’s science! You just did science! That’s all it is!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] You know the experiment [wheezes with laughter] What Does This Smell Like?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: What Does It Smell Like? That’s not a scientific experiment, that’s a creative writing prompt. [audience laughs] You dullard!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [knocks three times] “Hi, it’s me, Neil Degrasse [laughs] Tyson.” [audience laughs] “Did you do the experiment I told you about on television?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “You know, if the entirety of human existence was a calendar…”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Mm-hmm.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Then .0001 second to midnight is where you smell–” [breaks off laughing]<br><br>[audience laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Oh, I didn’t know you were doing Neil Degrasse Tyson there for a second. Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] I didn’t– I didn’t sound [laughing] exactly like Neil Degrasse Tyson?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] No, it was weird, you didn’t.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Neil, are you here? [a few people in the audience laugh and cheer] Shh! I can’t–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c2 c0">: I can’t hear Neil– <br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Holy shit, he’s here and there’s eighteen of them!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] It’s our worst nightmare! Neil Degrasse Tyson’s cloning himself.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: How about another question?<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. “Hey boys!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Hi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [simultaneously] Hi!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “I’ve been cosplaying at conventions for years and a few cons ago, an artist at a convention took a photo of me and asked to do a painting of me based off of it. The resulting painting was...” [pause] “not so great.” [audience laughs] “I’m reluctant to hang it in my home, but I feel like I shouldn’t get rid of it? Help? What do I do with this huge painting of me dressed in a silly superhero outfit?” And that’s from Stacy.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Stacy, you here?<br><br>[loud shriek from the audience]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Hi.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait. Are you a “Two-vian” throat singer? Why were there two…?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I– I just want to say, I heard– when you said “took a picture”– the acoustics in here are fucking incredible, because I heard– when you said they took a picture and wanted to do a painting of it, I heard one person, 2000 feet away, go, “Ugh.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I did see, today– I saw today, on the convention floor, someone take a photo of someone else’s art piece. And it was all I could do not to destroy that camera. [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [sighs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Because, the art piece–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That’s theft!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s just that one thing.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: The camera’s pretty much gettin’ it. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Gettin’ it. You got it.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You got all the art in there. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Okay, so…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You should– let me help. This is an advice show. [sing-song] Throw it in the trash can!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: In the trash can.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, throw it in the trash can.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: No, no, no, no, no. Short-sighted.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Short-sighted? Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c2 c0">: I have watched many a sitcom. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c2 c0">: Okay? </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">[a few people in the audience woop] </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I just rewatched Seinfeld. Have you guys seen that? [a portion of the crowd cheers] That’s pretty good.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That was a very tepid response!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. I cannot believe– by the way, IDW announced they’re bringin’ it back as a limited run, here at Comic Con, for eight issues. They’re gonna finish a lot of the storylines that they left lingering–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] </span><span class="c0 c5">Are </span><span class="c0">the pretzels making you thirsty? They are.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: They are, it turns out. Issue 3.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: The Crisis on Infinite Pretzels. We’re all very excited for it. <br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: But here’s what’s gonna happen. You throw that– throw it away. Someone drives by, they see the painting, they’re like, “Oh, it’s pretty nice,” and then they take it. Then, fifteen years from now, they get it appraised, hang it in some kind of gallery, the artist sees it, like, “Where did you find this?” “In the garbage.” And then they cry. <br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Or– I mean, by that point– I mean, having their work valued highly would probably be–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c2 c0">: They’d probably be maybe a little stoked in this imaginary situation you came up with. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Maybe a little jived about it.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: No! They painted that for you!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “It was a gift! I didn’t want a bunch of people to see it and be worth money!” [audience laughs] You’re bad at fuckin’ up–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait, hold on! I just had a huge realization!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: If an artist’s painting sells for a bunch money, the artist doesn’t get that money! If I sell a painting I already own, I get that money.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Hey, wait a minute.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: The artist is like, “My painting sold for </span><span class="c0 c5">how </span><span class="c0">much? Fuck!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Hey– <br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Dammit!”<br><br>[audience laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Hey, artists? [laughing] What the fuck?! Seems like you should keep gettin’ money offa that. That sucks. I’m gonna work on that for you, see what I can’t come up with.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Oh god– I got some things, I got some things cookin’. So Travis, your version of the Antiques Roadshow is: you go to the Antiques Roadshow and say, “Listen, I had something, and I don’t now. What do you think that is worth?” [wheezes with laughter] <br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly and claps] That would be the best ver– it already happens now, it’s my favorite version of the Antiques Roadshow. They’re like, “I have this lamp.” And it’s like, “Uh, did you polish this?” “I did.” “Oooh…” [audience laughs] “Well, polished, it’s worth $15. But with the patina? Two million.” [audience laughs] “Ah, well, thank you, okay.” [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: I would love it on one episode if they were like, “And did you, uhhhh, do you have the gravy boat that comes with it?” [in a terrible British accent] “Oh, actually, I don’t. I threw it out, didn’t I?” [audience laughs] And then the Antiques Roadshow person just puts their head on the table and is like, “Motherfucker!” [audience laughs] “Fuckin’–! What? Fuck! Fuck!” And it’s 15 minutes of that. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] And it just keeps cutting back to them.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: And it’s a pledge drive, so that’s not… <br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “Did you, ahhh… You s– you… still have the dust cover to this, right?” “No. I didn’t– when I bought it, it didn’t have a dust cover.” “Oh, okay.” … [softly] “Motherfucker.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “Son of a fuckin’ shit.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Fuck.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That is– all I’ve wanted from the Great British Bakeoff is...<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: For Paul Hollywood to take a bite of something and then look at the person and go, “This tastes like dog shit.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] It’s all I’ve ever wanted.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Or Mary Berry to be to be like, “If– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: All I’ve ever wanted is to watch the Great British Bake Show and Mary Berry takes a bite of something and says, “This tastes like dog shit.”<br><br>[audiences laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Well, I want Antiques Roadshow except the person’s like, “I think it’s worth $15,000, but who cares what I think?” And then Mary Berry comes out and takes a bite of the painting. [audience laughs] [in a terrible British accent] “It’s a good bake, innit? You did really good.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Wouldn’t it be funny if the tent, like, fell down? [laughs loudly]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [mocking voice] “What if Paul Hollywood just, like, </span><span class="c0 c5">farted</span><span class="c0">?” [regular voice] What are we doing? Why are people here?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Ha, that one gets me.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You got a future in–  You got a future at SNL, young man.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c2 c0">: Uh, how about this Yahoo. It was sent in by Zoe Kinskey. Thank you Zoe Kinskey. [audience cheers] Zoe, are you here? </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">[no response]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Okay, that would have been [laughs] like a gathering of the stars that I was not ready for. It’s by Yahoo Answers User “Katie” who asks– “Katie” has 66% best answers. That’s the the highest fuckin’– “Katie” knows what’s up.  [audience laughs] “How to sneak pancakes into a movie theater?” [audience laughs and cheers] “My brother and I are going to see a movie on Friday morning and we wanted to get IHOP. And then we thought it would be awesome to do both at once. But that means we’d have to sneak take-out in, and that’s a full meal.” [laughs] Uh, yep. “We have a few ideas on how to do this, but they mostly suck, so does anyone have ideas?” That was not my editorializing. And then a little smiley face at the end to let you know, like, it’s all fun.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I– here’s the thing. At this table, uhh, two of us have had jobs at movie theaters.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Justin, you worked at a movie theater once, didn’t you?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Nah, I had Blockbuster. It’s the movie theater in your home.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Well, the rest of the– [audience cheers] The rest of that sentence was going to be, “And across this table, we have been fired [laughs] twice from Blockbuster.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: But we’ve worked at movie theaters twice, and I feel like the “sneaking food in” thing is something that everybody’s a little, like, paranoid about, that you couldn’t be bothered less about.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, I couldn’t give less of a shit.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: You could walk into my movie theater with a pizza and, like, a growler, and I’d be like [makes some visual sign of apathy].<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Wearing a sport coat made of the pizza you planned to eat during the movie, and I’d be like, “You didn’t have to– just go…”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Go. Fine. Yeah.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Can I just have–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Enjoy Sky High, I don’t fuckin’ care.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Enjoy Sky High, just–”<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Some Sky High fans. Good crowd for that, I guess.<br><br>[audience cheers again, louder]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Alright, so, just so I’m clear, fuck Seinfeld but Sky High is…? [audience laughs and cheers] Awesome. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You’ve gotta get a top hat.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: And the thing is, you’re gonna have to stack some cake– you’re gonna do some cake stackin’... [audience laughs] in your hat. And then– That’s easy. We’ve got the easy part solved. Cakes– pancakes. [audience laughs] But then, you’re gonna get the shoe– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait, you gotta do it dry! Gotta do it dry.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Gotta do it dry ‘cause you’re gonna get those shitty plastic ramekins that are designed to open– that are designed to open– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: How do you know so much about how the IHOP fuckin’ goes?! [audience laughs] How they IHOP-erate.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That’s gonna be the hard thing is–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: No, that sucked, don’t. Don’t draw attention to it, it was bad.<br><br>[a few audience members cheer]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: IHOP-erate?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I wanna hear stories of Justin’s IHOP experiences.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: So what– you’re just gonna have to dump the syrup on… and get a good seal goin’.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Oh, wait! Straight up: freeze the syrup.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [slowly] Freeze the syrup!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Then put– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Then warm it up in your hands in the movie! [audience laughs] [Griffin blows into cupped hands]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] And now– listen, you’re gonna be tempted to go too far. And then you’ll just have [laughing] syrup on your hands, and that’s gonna be tricky.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And this– this process, it’s gonna make a lot of noise, ‘cause you’re gonna be in the theater, just like [breaths heavily into cupped hands]. And someone will turn around and say, like, “Can you please keep it down? It’s fuckin’ Despicable Me 3 and like my kids– and can you please–” And then you turn to them and you– <br><br>[a few audience members cheer at the mention of Despicable Me 3]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “I can’t hear the minions’ very important dialogue.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: You turn to them, and what’s great is you go [“blegh” noise] And you look like a weird syrup monster… [audience laughs] And no one fucks with that.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Wouldn’t it be sweet if movie theaters finally started selling syrup warmers? And they’re just like, “Yeah, we get it.” [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “That’ll be $7.” [audience laughs] So you get a water-tight, syrup-tight seal on your top hat. The problem is this. And I know you’ve all been thinking, “But Justin, wait, I’ve thought about it. When you go in, you see a gentleman or a gentlelady, and they’re gonna doff their cap to you…”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Aw shit!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: And then it’s like, “Am I gonna leave a gentle-bro hanging or not?” Because if I open it: preserves.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It’s gonna be fuckin’ compote, just–<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Compote slidin’ down your grill, that’s no good. But you’re not gonna leave a gentle-person hanging.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I gotta go for it.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Gotta go for it. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Gotta do it.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Doff it.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s how they get you. That’s why they have a doffer at every entrance.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [mimes doffing his hat] “Oh?– Ah!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Ah!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You doff your hat– Runts. Just falling down your face. Bulk Runts.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Fuck–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Could you try to explain to them? Like, “No, it’s… much cheaper… out there? They give you a lot of it… for less money? So I just did that.” [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “No, they’re structural Runts.” [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Do you have price-matching? ‘Cause I’ll do that... here...”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I would watch this show. And it’s just about the plight of a ticket-taker who, anytime anybody comes in with, like, a unique garb– a uniquely spacious garb– like somebody with platform shoes, like, “...Alright, go on in, but I’m lookin’ for fuckin’ spaghetti hangin’ outta those!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] The show’s just called, “It’s Cool, I’m Stoned.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: They should have a bake car where a guy hands you a box of Junior Mints outside, “Hey, can you hold these for me? It’s for a friend. I left the– she’s inside. If you could just carry these inside.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: When I worked security a– at a, uh… [quietly and slurred together] an electronics retailer. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [amused] It’s Best Buy. Why are you bein’ weird?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Shut up! [laughs] [audience laughs] I’m under an NDA! I’m not, it’s fine. They’re cool. [laughing] They understand. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Takin’ a while to back into this Best Buy story.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: It’s gonna be a good one guys, strap in!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I worked security–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: With this much build up?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: One of the things that you had to do to arrest someone was prove that they intended to leave without paying. So just ‘cause you saw someone put it in their pocket– maybe they were gonna pull it back out and pay for it at the register. [audience laughs] And so…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “This is my payment pocket!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “I wanna remind–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] “I need these hands free!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “I wanna remind myself to buy it. [laughs] So I put it here so I wouldn’t forget.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: So one time, this person was stealing a bunch of stuff, and they walked through the, you know, the detectors and it beeped. And [laughs] they looked at me and I just went, “You’re cool!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Travis!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [shouting; laughing] Because if they didn’t walk out the door, I wouldn’t get the arrest!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [shrilly] What the [laughing] fuck?!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Did you immediately go outside and tackle them?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: No, the cops did that. [audience laughs] That I had called. And prepared for this moment.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: This is– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Did you– holy– first of all, [laughs] you’re on stage describing entrapment… [audience laughs] And also, did you have a commission? Of just, like…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: No, but I did jump up and down so hard in joy I hurt my ankle.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [shrilly] Because you got someone arrested?!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: This is confusing to me because if you’re in Best Buy loss prevention, they have to leave the store before you can prove stealing, right?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Correct. Mm-hmm.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You take one fucking step out of that store and [laughing] you’re nothing. Like, you don’t have jurisdiction outside the store, right? Like, you have no power out there?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Correct.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: So, where is the, like… horizon– <br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I suspect it’s about to happen: “Hey. Is this the police?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Be ready.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “No, you did 811. We get this all the time, though. Try again.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “This is Sketcher’s.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Alright, Sketcher’s.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Why’s your phone number so fucking short?”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Wait, did you say </span><span class="c0 c5">Sketcher’s</span><span class="c0">?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Like the shoe– ?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: They’re also at the mall.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, okay. Got it.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Thank you. Come along with me. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Also, I don’t think [laughing] that’s a thing. I don’t think there’s a Sketcher’s store at the mall.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait, hold on!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh– please! We gotta do more fucking questions instead of talking about stores at the Huntington Mall!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [begins reading question] “My partner–” But did you hear the Payless and the Shoe Carnival merged?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Really?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: They’re just one big fuckin’ Shoe Carnival now. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Get out!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: It’s madness.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That seems like a monopoly.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: I love any investment in the ol’ girl. [audience laughing continuously] I’m just happy to see the dollars pouring in to the Huntington Mall.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Also, they expanded the Dicks. So now it’s a Dicks and a Field and Stream.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c2 c0">: Get the fuck out.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: I’m serious.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Really?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah! For a while– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Do they have a pet store back, or… ?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: For a while they, um, they built an additional entrance to Dicks because they were changing the other one to Field and Stream. So for a while, there were just two Dicks there. And it’s like, “I get it.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: This sucks so bad.<br><br>[audience laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: What’s at The Pied Piper now?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: What? The Pied Piper. It’s a mili– it’s a US Army recruitment station.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Really?<br><br>[audience laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Some– and there’s some parallelism there if you wanna get into the… but, um… two pretzel places, so.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Really? Which one’s better?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: One’s a kiosk, so they– they’re not gonna– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Is it Excalibur?<br><br>[audience laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: What?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Excalibur?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Excalibur’s still selling swords and Hummel figurines.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Nice, nice, nice.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Crushin’ it. They closed. I thought it’d be funnier for– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Did they rebuild the caramel corn [slurs the word “store”] sturr after it burned?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Sorry?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: The caramel corn sturr?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Please, oh god, you had to say it twice, that’s double–<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Now the [laughs] caramel corn store is now Dave’s. They have caramel corn. [pause] [burst of laughter] Also other things! You know, if Karamel Korn had thought to diversify– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I forgot until right now– !<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: They might not have burned down!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Let me get in on the bit, actually. I forgot we had a caramel corn store at the mall. [audience laughs] Not a restaurant, a retailer. I love it. How about another </span><span class="c0 c5">fucking </span><span class="c0">question?! [audience cheers] That was the sound of </span><span class="c0 c5">relief</span><span class="c0">.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: The caramel corn store at the mall was called “Karamel Korn,” but they spelled it with Ks. Okay, guys. Good try.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Havin’ fun with it. [slurs and slides through the words so they become an incoherent kind of wail] How about another question?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “My partner and I both like dancing, especially at parties. We wanted to up our wow factor, so we’re thinking of choreographing a full dance that we can whip out whenever a certain song comes on.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [spoken with his head in his hands] Go back to talking about the Huntington Mall.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “The question is, what party song do we use?” And that’s from Matilda. And Matilda, I have some bad news. You’ve chosen the wrong question.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: We see this sometimes.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] I didn’t know questions could be wrong?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. You’ve chosen the wrong question.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Are you– are you here, Matilda?<br><br>[Matilda woops from the audience]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Yeah, sorry. [audience laughs] No, that’s fair. It’s just– it’s just, I’m thinking about the amount of effort that goes into choreographing  a dance that you can bust out at events.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: We all understand the impulse. Everyone wants to look like a dancing queen.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Absolutely! Yeah, we’ve all seen, fuckin’, A Goofy Movie and thought, like, “Yeah, that would be…” [audience cheers] Like, yeah, that’s– that’s the dream. But at the same time, you work really hard to master this dance, how many times can you do it before your friends are just like– you show up to a party and you’re like, “Hey, does anybody– you got Uptown Funk on that thing?” And they’re like, “Fuck! God!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Oh! Good point, Griffin. So what you need to do: choreograph a dance…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That can work to any song?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Do it to any song! [audience laughs] Song comes on. “Yeah. This one!” Do the Chicken Dance, but it’s not the Chicken Dance.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: No, it’s not!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Not the Chicken Dance, it’s your own thing.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s the Turkey Dance.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Matilda, you–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s not great. It’s the best joke I had.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Shit.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Matilda, I’m not sure you should do this thing. And I think that it would be pretty fun the first time, but I do think that there’s going to be some devaluing in repetition with this, where you feel very good about it the first time– and honestly? The first time? People are gonna fuckin’ nut about it. They’re gonna be– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: They’re gonna be really stoked about it, and you’ll feel stoked about it, and then you’ll be like, “Those McElroy idiots! They don’t know anything!” And then it’s gonna be a funeral or it’s gonna be… [audience laughs] and that song’s gonna come on, and there’s gonna be a part of you that’s like, “This is inappropriate.” And there’s gonna be another part of you where it’s like, “We did practice a lot...” [audience laughs] “Seems like a shame to miss it.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “And this is maybe the only time I’m ever gonna be at a funeral where they’re playin’ Uptown Funk…”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] But the slow ballad version! <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: The slow acoustic Uptown Funk. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [sings Uptown Funk with a very slow rhythm] “I said uptown funk you up, I said, uptown funk you up!” What if you pulled a move directly from 90’s TV and just yelled, “Do the Matilda!” And then just saw what everybody did. And whatever they did, is now the Matilda.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That’s the dance! I like that!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s the Matilda now: everybody going “Hmm?” That’s the dance! Mmm? Mmm. Mmm? Mmm.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: You know what– you know what else I like is– <br><br>[audience laughs at Travis’ continued “Matilda” imitations]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: You get this dance going at a friend’s wedding– steal the fuckin’ spotlight, love that!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Take that, Derek!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And then… you fuckin’ pack your bags and you move away. [audience cheers] I’m talking about you are now living an Incredible Hulk Pretender-esque lifestyle, which is like, “Hey, yeah, I just moved here to Milwaukee, I need some new friends.” You spend like a month ingratiating yourself, get invited to that new party, and then you’re like, [laughing] “Is this Uptown Funk?” [audience laughs] You funk it up– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “No, it’s Garth Brooks’ ‘The Dance,’ and we’ve told you that several times.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And then it’s like, “Where did Matilda go– ? Aww, moved to Phoenix...” [audience laughs] “Had work there.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Lemme suggest this. They play Uptown Funk. Natch. [audience laughs] You dance to it… bad.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, no.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: You do a bad job. Everyone’s like, [awkward person noises] “Mm, boo, this–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “I thought they practiced this, that wasn’t very good.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, this is bad, right? And then you turn to the DJ and you go, “You know what? Give us one more shot.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Play Uptown Funk twice in a row!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Professional DJ, whose one charge is not doing that exact thing!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: The DJ says it– DJ sees somethin’ in your eyes and he goes, “You know what?” [pause] “I’m gonna give ‘em a shot.” [audience laughs] And he plays it again and everyone’s like, “Didn’t we just… ?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Didn’t he just play this?”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [high pitched; words running together] “Didn’t he just play this?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Is he okay?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: But then–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “How much did you pay this– ?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: They see you swing dance to it, which is of course, the best dancing.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br>[a few people in the audience cheer]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Unmuted.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] To Uptown Funk, it’s the best dance you can do is an old timey swing dance.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It fits to any song.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Sure. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Have you not seen… [pause] [laughing] swing dancing?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: How about a Yahoo? [audience cheers] This one was sent in by level 9000 Ya-Drew druid Drew Davenport, thank you Drew! [audience cheers] It’s from Ya-Drew Answers user–<br><br>[Griffin’s cut off by Drew shouting from the audience]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: What?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Drew</span><span class="c0">: That’s my 200th!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh! That’s his 200th one!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah! [audience cheering] Can we get a little bit of house lights, please!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Can we get the house lights up, please? Could we get house lights up, please?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c2 c0">: House lights? Little bit.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">[audience continues to cheer]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: If that’s possible?

It’s our show now!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Alright, let’s do the question. [mock-startled] Wait a minute! This one’s super racist! Drew!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Drew, you Milkshake Ducked us! [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: This one was asked by Ya-Drew Answers user “Sara W.” who asks: “Does Batman eat or drink while he is Batman or does he wait until he is Bruce Wayne?” [audience laughs] I think–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing and clapping]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Travis is laughing for a very specific reason that we will get into in a second. “I think that Batman is in costume so long sometimes that he must at least drink water to keep himself hydrated. But my friend thinks that there must be a hydration IV in Batman’s utility belt.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s not fucking Dune!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That makes a lot–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: He’s not in a Fremen’s suit!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That makes a lot of sense, Batman doesn’t know how long he’s going to be hiding up there. When he’s in the rafters or what have you. [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: So he just wants the hydration built in, and a catheter... [pause] we must assume. [audience laughs] My favorite Batman series is Batman: The Catheter is Assumed.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] It only ran for a few issues, it was soundly rejected by critics, but it meant somethin’ to me, dammit. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Here’s why I’m laughing. When Griffin and I were walking to The Adventure Zone [laughs] show yesterday, we saw a guy in a full, like, Christian Bale Batman, Dark Knight Batman, ordering some Indian food. [audience laughs] He was still wearing the cowl and everything. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And then we had a lot of fun with the rest of our walk of just, like, [Batman voice] “Are the samosas particularly spicy?”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [Batman voice] “How spicy are the samosas?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [Batman voice] “Is the naan dairy-free?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing and clapping his hands]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: This is fun. I would actually love to like– I don’t know how we’d do this, but I would love to hear from the audience about– my favorite– this is my first time at Comic Con and it’s been– [audience cheers] Thank you, thank you. I don’t know why I’m thanking you. [laughs] I came to a show, I did a thing. Um, and the best part– other than watching Justin’s face as he is slowly consumed by a mob of people racing to meet the cast of The Flash–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Quick side note. I was tryin’ to cross the fuckin’ floor, and I hear, [speaks into his hand to imitate a voice on a speaker] “Does anybody out there like The Flash?!” And then I looked– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: The answer from everyone on Earth was, “Yeah.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] And then, I hear, “Welcome to the stage, the cast of The Flash!” And I look up, and just like a fuckin’ omen of death, there’s John Wesley Shipp, just starin’ back at me. It might also have been Grant Gustin, I have a hard time tellin’ them apart, they look so similar, they’re father and son. And they’re looking down at me and I realize, “Oh god…”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin &amp; Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “They’re– I can see them… so good.” And then I turn around and it’s just like this mob of iPhones raised high in the air, squishing me and my dad as we try to get away from the show floor and get out of there and we were almost killed by this hoard of people trying to see the cast of this show– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I’m sorry, Justin, I have to stop you.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Or you might also call it a–  no, Travis, you don’t, because I’m going to be the first to say “flash mob” out loud.<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Okay. No, no, no. No, I’m sorry, our dad has just texted us. Our dad has just texted us, mid-show: “I saw a Golden Age Flash riding on one of those pedal-thingies yesterday.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That’s very good. Golden Age Flash in a pedicab is funny on a lot of different levels, but this is what– this was my favorite thing of Comic Con, is cosplay people as characters doing mundane things that it is so inappropriate– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: And this is all-time maybe funniest thing I’ve ever fucking seen in my whole life, and I feel uncomfortable conjuring the specter of this scene here during this liveshow. ‘Cause it’s gonna be funnier than anything that we could possibly say. When we were at the Marriott pool bar the other day, I was walking outside and I passed by a table, and there was Dumbledore...<br>[audience laughs] And he was eating out of a styrofoam to-go box, some buffalo wings!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin &amp; Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: We saw Pepsi Man peeing in a urinal!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: We saw Pepsi Man piss in the bathroom as soon– ! [audience laughs and cheers] We got here, day one, we’re like, “Let’s go to the bathroom before we get into it.” And there was fuckin’ Pepsi Man, “shwaaa,” just, like, pissing!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s become my new favorite thing, to see these really intricate cosplays, like, “That’s great.” And then [laughs] the first time they walk in the bathroom, they have to go, “Fuck.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Fuck.” Uh, if you’ve got a really good one, and– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Can we get house lights?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: House lights for a second? If you’ve got a really good one– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Cosplay character doing an awesome mundane thing.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Really good!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. It has to be a superhero doing a mundane thing. Two: it has to be real. If you lie, we’ll know. And three: it has to be short. If you have something fitting that description– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Uh-oh. Not as many takers as I [high pitched] thought there would be for this.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: We have microphones… somewhere. Right?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Uh, you could also just shout it. I don’t think the mics are out just yet.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay, hold on, wait! I’m just gonna– right here. <br><br>[audience member shouts]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That’s pretty good.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: A Raven with her dress over her shoulder.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That’s pretty good. When you were dressed up as the Raven, you had to put your cape over your shoulder when you went to the restroom. I felt weird repeating that? But... <br>        <br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That’s fine. Right there, in the back.<br><br>[audience member shouts]<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, shit!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Hold on, we got– we have to repeat these things into the microphone. Griffin? What did he see?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: He saw a guy dressed as Sasuke from Naruto get arrested. Now, I will say this. I’ve never been arrested and taken to jail, but if I was...<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I would love to be dressed up like a Naruto character.<br><br>[audience claps and laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I saw– last night walking down the street with my friends Paul and Storm, I saw a superhero, bunched up vomiting. [laughs]<br><br>[there are a mixture of “Ooh”s and laughter from the audience]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: And I saw a lot of other superheroes walk by without helping. [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: This is specifically what Uncle Ben was talking about.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That’s– this is my favorite parable, Jesus, thank you for sharing it with me. Uh, I’m having a little bit of a hard– right here. [a few people shout from the audience] Hold on, I’m pointing at this person.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Hold on, we’ll do– we’ll do balcony in a second!<br><br>[audience member shouts]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin &amp; Justin</span><span class="c0">: Saw Batman petting a ferret!<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c2 c0">: Pretty good.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Batman petting a ferret!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Just like Batman to– balcony, yes!<br><br>[audience member shouts]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin &amp; Justin</span><span class="c0">: Doctor Manhattan eating a hotdog!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [shrilly shouting] You can fuckin’ teleport to Jupiter, what are you doing?!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Right there! [audience member shouts] Princess Belle complaining about her boyfriend on a cell phone! Right there. I’m looking– yes. Yes, you and then the person who’s right next to you. You first. Yes, standing up!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, you’re doin’ it! You’re doin’ it!<br><br>[audience member shouts]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: A Power Ranger who put his cell phone– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: There was a twist right there at the end!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: In his crotch! Excellent, excellent– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: But when they did that, did the fucking Megazord show up?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br>[audience member shouts]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Oh.<br><br>[audience member continues]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, nice! Okay, well, good for them!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Was getting someone’s number! Excellent. Alright, right behind you, like two rows back. Yes.<br><br>[audience member shouts]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah! Drunk Naruto! Barfin’ down the front, just like Naruto does.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Naruto– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [talking into his hands] I’ve never seen Naruto…!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Uh, I– I have one.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yes, Travis?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yes, Travis.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I saw a Harley Quinn and the Joker that she was with calling her mom to be picked up. [laughs] <br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That’s extremely good.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That made pretty happy.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [imitating The Joker] “I’m like a dog chasing my mom’s car!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br>[audience laughs and claps]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [imitating The Joker] “I wouldn’t know what to do with it if I caught it. I’d get in her mid-sized sedan.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [imitating The Joker] “And I’d go back to–” <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [imitating The Joker] “I’d get back home in time for meatloaf.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [imitating The Joker] “And I’d go back to Dad’s house, ‘cause it’s every other weekend!” [audience laughs] Right there. Yes, stand up. Yes.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Okay, okay, okay, everybody be cool!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Be cool, be cool, be cool, I need to hear the story!<br><br>[audience member continues]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: What?!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Get the fuck right out!<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: PETA called the cops on a furry– ?!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: PETA called the cops on the [high-pitched, squeaky incredulity] furry convention?! [audience laughing] That doesn’t fit within the context of our thing, but I very much appreciate this!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Hold on, wait, wait, timeout. I’m sensing there’s more. <br><br>[audience member continues]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, the LAPD officer– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s– That’s what I expected, just a cop going, “And what do I…?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “What is it… you– ?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “And who do I arrest?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Hey, I can’t arrest a fucking dog!” Hold up!

All the kids are into the X-Games right now, it’s a very hot airport.

Congrats on getting into grad school. I hope!” A cold shot there, Andrew Josay, although I’m sure Morgan pulled it off. “Happy Birthday, good luck at Camp Hollywood and ILHC, and Merry Christmas.

Love, Andrew.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I like that end turn there, Andrew, you know– but you know what really matters?

Oh! We’re doing– can we talk about…?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, we should!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Alright, we’re doin’ liveshows! This fall, we’re doing a lot of liveshows!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, all over. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, so basically, we are going to be putting tickets on sale this Friday at noon, local time to the different locations.

October 20th, we’re gonna be at the Cobb Energy… Theater, I guess? Is that a field? <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I don’t know. Cobb Energy.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Sounds serious. That’s in Atlanta GA, and then on the 21st, we’re gonna be doing MBMBAM in Nashville at Andrew Jackson Hall, and then on the 22nd, the day after, we’re gonna be doing also at Andrew Jackson Hall in Nashville, The Adventure Zone.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: In November, we’re hittin’ the Chicago Theater on November 17th. You can guess what city that’s in. The Orpheum Theater in Minneapolis on November 18th, and The Riverside Theater in Milwaukee on November 19th. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: And a final– to finish up along, in conjunction I would say, in the time schedule with PodCon in December, we will be doing an Adventure Zone live at the Pantages Theater in Tacoma WA, December 8th. So all those tickets are going on sale this Friday at noon, local to the times where the cities are.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: If you live in one of those cities or you wanna get there for one of those shows, it’s– we have no quality control we could possibly do with any of these things, so, like, be online and ready to buy tickets ahead of time and, like, may the odds be ever in your favor. We– there– I hope everything goes well, but I– it’s kind of… way beyond our [laughs] paygrade, so…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: We’re gonna have links to all these if you go to mcelroyshows.com, we’ll have a–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: McElroy– yeah, we’ll have a header: “Tours.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Tours.” And you can click that and get the links. But it’ll be noon your time on Friday– this Friday. Even the shows in December go on sale this Friday at noon.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: We’ll tweet the links and everything too.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yep. Good luck! And we love you! And thanks!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Please come out and tell everybody, ‘cause they’re big shows and we haven’t been to some of these places before at all, so we just wanna make sure to see everybody, ‘cause sometimes it takes a long time in-between us doin’ this stuff, so…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Come on out.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Uhh, I think that’s it, yeah?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yep!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Enjoy the rest of the show!

[audience cheers] Normally the podcast is just My Brother, My Brother, and Me but today… it’s the Munch Squad.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly] This is like the 10th time you’ve done Munch Squad, it was… not a good transition.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Uhh, thanks, Dad. [audience laughs] Today’s Munch Squad was submitted to us by one [laughing] Sydnee McElroy.<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It’s funny. She… doesn’t care for My Brother, My Brother, and Me so much. </span><span class="c0 c5">Huge</span><span class="c0"> Munch Squad fan.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. Deep in the Squad. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Whoever makes those Munch Squad-only [laughing] Youtube cuts, Sydnee sure appreciates that.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Applebee’s has introduced a new “Topped and Loaded” menu.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait, Applebee’s? “Eatin’ Good in the Neighborhood” Applebee’s?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That’s the one. Except… it’s not… that.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] It’s Eating Bad in the Neighbor-Sad.<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Thanks.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay, the funny– the thing I enjoy about the Topped and Loaded menu, is that when– as I say the words to you, it’s going to sound normal. And then your brain is gonna start processing it and you’re gonna realize that that is not the case. <br><br>[a few people in the audience laugh]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [reading press release] “Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill and Bar today unveils Topped and Loaded, a limited-time lineup of crave-able, customizable entrees. Starting at only $10.99, at participating restaurants, the Topped and Loaded menu features four protein choices–” Let me just say, so appetizing.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Three delicious toppers, and four side options, giving guests an abundance of mouth-watering combinations to choose from. Guests are invited to explore a variety of options and build their perfect meal.” [whispers to self] Perfect meal. [regular volume] If this is your perfect meal… [laughs] Please. Oh, my last meal? I want it to be Topped and Loaded.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Here are the– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Let’s be bad.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Let’s be bad.<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I mean…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Do you want dessert?” “Well, we did kill 18 people, so…”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “I was– I was very bad when I did all the murders, and I’m going to continue being bad. Top and load that shit.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: It says, “They can build their perfect meal in these three simple steps.” Oh, boy. You know you got a real hit on your hands when there’s a flow chart for your dinner. “So you start with your protein base.” It says that.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Like, soylent. Like, start with– [press release] “A: Chicken breast. B: Bonin’ pork chop.” Nice.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, it’s “Bone-in”, never mind. “6oz USDA choice top sirloin or 8oz USDA choice top sirloin.” Alright. [laughs] I don’t know how my hunger differentiates [laughing] between the exact same 6 or 8oz steak, but here we go.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “You know what? I’m hungry… but I’m only three quarters as hungry as I might be…”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [not press release] “Actually, can you shave 1oz off the 8? ‘Cause I feel like a 7– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “I’m 7oz hungry.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] You gotta pour the 8 in the 6oz, and what’s left…”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It’s like the Diehard puzzle.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [deep voice] “Excuse me, I saw you shave 1oz off of his steak? I want a 7 but I ordered a 6. Can I have his ounce? So we all have 7s?” Then you’re gonna pick your topper. On your protein. And here are the options. “C: The cajun shrimp topper, which includes blackened shrimp, sauteed onions, and savory lemon butter–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Feels– I feel kinda bad for shrimp that it didn’t make the protein base cut!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Bacon beer cheese topper.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Fuck!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That’s made of: “Blue Moon white cheddar beer cheese”– spared no expense–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: This is just called the Goodbye Option. [laughs]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Nah, that one’s next. “Bacon, crispy onions, and fresh green onions.” Hey, Applebee’s? I trust you to put something fresh on my Topped and Loaded about as far as I can throw you, but thank you. [audience laughs] It’s very sweet of you to write. And finally... “The marinara mozzarella stick topper.” And then it says– the next part of the sentence is, “consisting of,” and it’s like, yeah, I fucking get it. [audience laughs] You fuckin’ assholes, I know what you’re doin’. Uh, [press release] “crispy mozzarella sticks, classic marinara sauce, and… a parmesan cream sauce.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh my god!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: What the </span><span class="c0 c5">fuck</span><span class="c0">?! How do you get a steak, and you put mozzarella sticks on it, and then you put marinara on it, and someone’s like, “[smacks lips] There’s somethin’ missing.” [audience laughs] “I could do more.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Here’s the thing. I am not above ordering mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, and then a steak as the dinner. But if the server tripped…<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: And dropped the app plate on the steak plate, I would say, “Redo that, please.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, try–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “Try again.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “Try again.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “This isn’t fine. This is not fine.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: This is– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Is there– I have to ask a question of this character. Is there a limit to Let’s Be Bad…?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Where the mozzarella sticks on a steak and then they put marinara sauce on the sticks and then they put... a fuckin’ parmesan cream sauce on top of the other sauce. Is– will Let’s Be Bad see that and say, like... [sighs heavily]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Well, here’s the–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “Nobody’s that bad.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s the difference between “Let’s be bad” and “let’s fuck up.” [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “Let’s be–” [cuts off with a laugh]<br><br>[audience laughs and claps]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: But what does Applebee’s have to say for themselves?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [chuckles] “We’re sorry!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “We did it bad, I don’t know!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “We’re so, so sorry!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [press release] “Our Topped and Loaded menu gives guests what they’ve always wanted.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “A cheap–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “If they really admit it! Look within yourself!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [not press release] It gives our guests what they’ve always wanted: a cheap and easy death. [audience laughs] The cha– [cuts off laughing] A swift, painful passing from this thing they call mortality.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: A mozzarella escape!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: A mozzarella mortality escape!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: To show up in front of St. Peter’s pearly gates and have him say, “You look like shit.” [audience laughs] “What–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “Did you do the parmesan sauce?! Jesus!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “What… happened? You smell like ass, you gave the porn [??] you’re goin’ to hell, I hate this.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [chuckles]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Uhh, [press release] “give them what they’ve always wanted: the chance to top one favorite with another to disc–” [stumbles, laughing] “Discover a creative and tasty spin on a classic.” Hey, how’s your fuckin’ bucket list goin’? Pretty bad, it seems! Just the one item on there, the one thing you’ve always wanted? Is to put mozzarella sticks on an Applebee’s steak and then marinara sauce and cream sauce? Fuck off!<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: The steak’s pretty good, but what bums me out is it stops here. [most likely indicating with his hand] [audience laughs] But what if it stopped… here? [most likely indicating with his hand further out]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Thomas Yun, the executive chef of Applebee’s– [snorts]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Says, “I quit! I’m done!” [audience laughs] “This is it. I knew you would push me too far at some point and this is it.” [audience laughs] “I’ve quit in a press release before, but…”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: It– no, I love Thomas, he’s my new guy. Because it– he gets audacious here. [press release] “For example, pairing the chicken breast with the marinara mozzarella stick topper with the parmesan cream sauce is a deconstructed and reinvented [barely containing laughter] chicken parmesan.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly] [audience laughs] Is there– okay. Is that sentence… are there a weird string of capitalized letters in there where it’s perhaps a secret message, like, “They’ve got me trapped in the bunker. Please send help”?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Says it’s a– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Please send broccoli or–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “Broccoli or–”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Celery, at this point, we’ll take it.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: “You want– you want me to bread it?” “No, please.” [press release] “And reinvented chicken parmesan that satisfies and delights the taste buds in a way that is... uniquely Applebee’s.” Thomas Yun? On this, we can agree.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [abruptly begins to cough loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [in response to the coughing] Jesus! [audience laughs] [laughing] That was the worst sonic experience I’ve ever had!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: I’m regre– I am legitimately sorry, I got a little choked.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Uhh, let’s do audience questions! Can we get lights up? Every– so we’ll– don’t come down just yet. Just raise your hand and we’ll call ya up, sort of Price is Right style.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Hold on, hold on, before we call anybody. We have one rule.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Do you know what it is?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Audience</span><span class="c0">: No bummers!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Okay, now you might hear that and think, “Okay, but mine...” No.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: No! [laughs] <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, not just one. And if you start it with, “I know this sounds like a bummer, but–” Mmm, nope, nope, nope.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Uh-huh. Let’s do left– let’s just work our way across and then… balcony, I’m sorry, we have nothin’– nothin’ for you.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: If you’ve got a really good one, come down to the lobby and just listen.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, I guess so. Alright, left side, what’s up? [pause] Nothin’ I guess.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Right– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Wait! Yeah, no, that person who was getting pointed at by another person with a sword. Yes. Yes. The only person in that whole section with their hand up.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you– the first person who st– yes! You’re good!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yes, yes!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Come on down!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis &amp; Griffin</span><span class="c0">:        Yes!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yes! Yes! Come on!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It continues to be you!        <br><br>[audience claps and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I fucking love– this is the only show we’ve ever done where Travis said, “The person with the sword pointing at somebody else,” and there were like six people like, “Nice!”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s down here. That– right above you. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It’s down here, it’s right by the steps.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: It’s down here.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Can we get a little bit more house lights?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Hi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Audience member</span><span class="c0">: Hello!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Hello.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Hey, what’s your name?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Audience member</span><span class="c0">: Jarek. [sic]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Hi! We’ve met you at the booth– at the signing thing, hi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: Hi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: How’s it goin’? <br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: Not bad–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Are you having fun at the con? What have you seen?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: You guys.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Okay, good.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Fair. What’s your question, Jarek?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Sounds like a pretty shitty con so far.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: Hey, I was emotional!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: So I have this thing where, multiple times, random people that I’ve never met before, they think they know me? And they’ll go– oh, start waving, or, like, “I think I remember you from somewhere!” And some of them are so excited to see me, they go up and give me a hug?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: And then when they pull away, they see my frightened face.  [audience laughs] And then they’re like, “I thought I knew you…” [laughs] What’s the best way of diffusing the situation?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: God– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c2 c0">: Where are you at that that’s happening? A hug but I’m not gonna look at your face first.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: Uh, it’s happened at, like, school and Comic Con and just… when I’m out at–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Jarek, as I live– I live with social anxiety, which– the main way it manifests is, like, I don’t know what to fuckin’ say to people. Especially with meeting new people, I have no idea. Maybe you should stop looking this incredible gift in the mouth, like… [audience laughs] Or gift horse, rather. That’s the expression. <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Don’t look a gift in the mouth, as they say.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Don’t look a gift in the mouth. [audience laughs] This person has come up and hugged you! I think you got a friendship brewin’ right there!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yeah!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s way better, rather than your frightened face, if they pull back and you’re going... [pulls some kind of face]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “I don’t know you!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Well, just stare ‘em dead in the eyes and be like, [deep sultry voice] “Welcome aboard.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [deep sultry voice] “Shall we exchange contact info?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [deep sultry voice] “It may seem you’ve gotten on the wrong train now, but look around you. Maybe it’s the perfect– not where you wanted–” <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] [singing Sweet Transvestite] “I see you’ve met my–” [cuts off laughing]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: So I think just lean into it and make a new friend.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Do lean into the hug. Push them down.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, what do you do with the hug? ‘Cause a hug is a two-person thing, usually. Unless it’s bad– do you return it, or… ?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: Well, I try and, like, kind of be like, “Y-yeah, we’re friends?” But it’s like, I– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s good of you!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, that’s very kind.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, that’s very sweet, Jarek.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: I just don’t wanna give it too much of a, “Oh, yeah, we’re definitely this close” kind of– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Don’t be the first one to break that contact though.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. And I like how you leave a little mystery in there, that’s nice.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: We were at a party earlier today and I was getting up to leave and go to the hotel and I was sittin’ at a table, and some dude came in and took my seat. And I guess Dad was also about to leave? And he leaned over this gentleman, and then caught himself, and then saw me standing up, and said like, “Oh! Ha! I was just about to kiss this man on the head ‘cause I was leaving.” [audience laughs] And the man– the gentleman was a bald gentleman? And so, like, I kinda think Dad just wanted to kiss a stranger on the…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: He just saw a very nice-looking head and was like, “Aw, don’t mind if I–” [makes a kissing noise] [audience laughs] So it could be much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much worse, is what I’m saying.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: So is it possible that there’s someone out in the world impersonating you?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh shit.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: I’ve suspected that?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: A Jarek-alike.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Or worse. [pause] [soft] Maybe it’s you.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Memento! [audience laughs and claps] So you– anyway, you got Momento disease. Sorry.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Sorry about that.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Sorry. Glad we could help.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It turned out okay for them in the movie, I think? I haven’t seen it in a long time.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] I can’t remember how it ends!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Yeah.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah. Anyway. Does that help?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: Definitely.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Cool.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Thanks.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Cool.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Jarek</span><span class="c0">: Thank you!<br><br>[audience claps and cheers]<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Uhhh, yeah.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Oh, wait!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah– no– yes, yes, you in the fr– yes, you with the– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It’s– yes, the Angus!<br><br>[audience claps and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I always get so uncomfortable, ‘cause sometimes I </span><span class="c0 c5">think </span><span class="c0">people are cosplaying as Angus McDonald, but then it c– that could just be your fashion, and if that’s the case, like fuckin’ cool– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That is my favorite Comic Con game. Cosplay or Weird Fashion Choice?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Not weird! No! Hey, come on!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Not weird!

And I want to see if you have any advice for someone aspiring to– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Wait, stop! Turn the microphone around. <br><br>[microphone clattering]<br><br>[audience laughs and cheers loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: That’s good.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Alright. Alright, I’ll– can– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Alright, now Alex– <br><br>[microphone feedback]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: This is great. What I love about this is, is the first time you do stand up comedy, you’re gonna fail, right?<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: It’s why I’ve never done it once!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c2 c0">: [snorts]<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Ha-ha!

Pretty good, right, pretty good?<br><br>[audience cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: I’m a cosplayer myself and, like, you know, I’ve done a few things and stuff. The worst experience I’ve had doing that, though, is I was, like, a little Robin cosplayer, I had little tights on and everything. It was fantastic. And then I got diarrhea.<br><br>[audiences laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [from the background] That’s good!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: So, for the last half of the con, I shoved toilet paper down the back of my pants. And I really just refused to stand up anywhere. But I got tons of kids asking me to take pictures with them. Boy, was it hard to look a kid in the face and go, “...N-no.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] “I’m not doin’ that. I really can’t. Because there’s doo-doo all up in this little thing.” So I try not to cosplay anymore– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Ten– ten seconds, bring it home.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: Unless I got underwear on. And lemme tell you, MeUndies is a great prod– sponsor! <br><br>[audience cheers loudly]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: [shouting over the crowd cheering] They’re sponsoring me right now! Aren’t they great?! Aren’t they fantastic?!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay! Alexi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Ladies and gentlemen, Alexi!<br><br>[audience continues cheering] <br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Alexi! Alexi! <br><br>[cheering dies down]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Here’s $20. [audience begins cheering again] Ladies and gentlemen– okay, no, well, we’ll just keep the $20. But congratulations, Alexi’s now a professional stand up comedian.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: Thank you!<br><br>[audience claps and cheers]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: That’s the most we’ve ever helped someone ever.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: We fixed the whole thing. Thanks, Alexi. You can just put that back right there– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: They didn’t keep the money.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: No! You gotta take the money!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: The symbolism is shattered.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: That was the whole gesture! <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: You gotta take the fuckin’ money!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: You gotta take it!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: Take a picture with me after the show!<br><br>[by the sound of the crowd and the reactions, presumably, Alexi handed the $20 to another audience member]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay, we need the next– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Take– ! No, you don’t get to keep it, you give that to Alexi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Give it to ‘em.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Alexi, if you don’t take that twenty– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: He’s a good guy! He’s a good guy! Hey’s a good guy.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Alright.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs] It’s his money, he can do what he wants with it.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Alexi</span><span class="c0">: [laughs]<br><br>[a few audience members woop]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Right side! Right side! Let’s go a little bit further back. There’s somebody jumping up and down in the aisles. Yep! Jumpin’ up and down. Way on the way back– yep!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Yes!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Yes!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yep! You got it!<br><br>[audience cheers and claps]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: [singing The Price is Right theme music]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, it’s you! [laughing] You know you can stop pointing at your face!? I promise it’s you!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Still me?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I promise! [audience laughs] Hi!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Audience member</span><span class="c0">: Hi.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Oh, I’m sorry, we were pointing... <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, no, it was… [audience laughs] I’m so sorry.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: This is awkward.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Audience member</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] It’s okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: What’s your name?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: I’m Nine.

I like it a lot.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: Thank– oh!<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Oh, DuckTales too, that’s choice.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: My DuckTales shirt. Yeah. [laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Okay.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: Hi, so I– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Hello.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: I’ve been collecting toys, like action figures and plushies since I was in high school.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: Mm-hmm.<br>        <br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: And I have a pretty substantial collection right now, but the thing is is that I have a niece now who comes and visits me a lot, and she’s really little, and she always wants to, like, touch everything?<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin</span><span class="c0">: Mmm. Mm-hmm.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: And for right now, she knows pretty much, you know, I have some stuff and I’m like, “No, not that stuff.” But what I’m worried about is when she grows up, she’s gonna be like all, “Why can’t I play with those toys?”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Justin &amp; Travis</span><span class="c0">:        Mm-hmm.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: And I’m gonna have to tell her, “You know, those are my [laughs] grown up toys.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: [laughs loudly]<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I’m new to this whole taking care of a kid thing. Don’t use the phrase “grown up toys.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Yeah.<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: It will not go well.<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: I’m so torn, because part of me wants to be like... I mean, there’s like fuckin’ movie– the fuckin’ Toy Story 2 mode just like, “Toys are supposed to be played with! Take ‘em out of the box!” But at the same time, like... that’s–<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: I guarantee my Harry Houdini action figure’s like, “I’m fine.”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: Yeah, I– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “I’m good. That’s a–”<br><br>[audience laughs]<br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: “Please don’t let your baby gum on me.”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: “That’s a mech I built for two weeks from Neon Genesis Evangelion. You don’t know how to play with that!” [audience laughs and cheers] “You would be bad at playing with that! You’re not ready to play with that!”<br><br></span><span class="c1">Nine</span><span class="c0">: [laughing] Yeah! [audience laughs] The thing is is that I do– I have been buying more, like, toys that she can play with because I do wanna share that kinda stuff with her…<br><br></span><span class="c1">Griffin</span><span class="c0">: Well, also– <br><br></span><span class="c1">Travis</span><span class="c0">: You could just put those low.

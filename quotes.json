    " Hey Robin? Stop it. I hate that guy.",
    " Does anybody ever refer to him by just his first name? That was just so strange to me when you said that.",

    " Yeah, just wear them while you're running, and no other time, EVER.",
    " That's like, if I were a 55 year-old surfer, and I just rolled around in a wet suit all the time. Just like ALL the time.",
    " Or, or FLOATed around in a wet suit until the Coast Guard came by.",
    " Well then you just do a slight wave and say, Please don't try to see my balls! As you run past.",
